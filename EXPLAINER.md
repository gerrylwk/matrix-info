To design a 2-dimensional matrix where each value represents multiple types of categorical information, you can use a bitmask or a binary encoding approach. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. **How It Works:**
We store categorical information inside each cell of the matrix using bits
- Assume you have N types of information (e.g., Information 1, Information 2, ..., Information N).
- Each type of information can be represented as a bit in an integer value.

### 2. **Binary Representation:**
   - Assign each piece of information a unique bit position:
     - Information 1 → 2^0 (0001 in binary)
     - Information 2 → 2^1 (0010 in binary)
     - Information 3 → 2^2 (0100 in binary)
     - ...
     - Information N → 2^(N-1)
   - For example, if you have 3 types of information:
     - Information 1 → 1 (0001 in binary)
     - Information 2 → 2 (0010 in binary)
     - Information 3 → 4 (0100 in binary)

### 3. **Store Information:**
   - To store multiple pieces of information in a single matrix cell, you can combine the bits using a bitwise OR (`|`).
   - For instance:
     - If you want to store Information 1 and Information 2 together, the value would be `1 | 2 = 3` (0011 in binary).
     - If you want to store Information 2 and Information 3 together, the value would be `2 | 4 = 6` (0110 in binary).

### 4. **Retrieve Information:**
   - To check whether a specific piece of information is stored in a matrix cell, use a bitwise AND (`&`).
   - For example:
     - To check if Information 1 is present in a cell with value `X`, check `X & 1`.
     - If the result is non-zero, Information 1 is present.

### Example:
Suppose you have a 2x2 matrix:

latex formatting... needs fix but laze
|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 2 |
| 7 | 4 |


- `Matrix[0,0] = 5` (0101 in binary) indicates Information 1 and Information 3.
- `Matrix[0,1] = 2` (0010 in binary) indicates Information 2.
- `Matrix[1,0] = 7` (0111 in binary) indicates Information 1, Information 2, and Information 3.
- `Matrix[1,1] = 4` (0100 in binary) indicates Information 3.

This way, each value in the matrix effectively represents multiple pieces of categorical information.
